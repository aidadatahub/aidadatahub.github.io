A first small dataset was successfully shared
[already in June](/news/2024-06-04-first-scapis-shared/), as a first live
verification of technical and procedural readiness. Now, the bulk of
the data from 30000 individuals has been transferred over, and is available for
sharing through the AIDA Data Hub. The data is structured as
[24 SCAPIS datasets](/datasets/scapis/#scapis-datasets), corresponding to four
CT examination types ([body](/datasets/search/?q=scapis%20lung),
[CASC](/datasets/search/?q=scapis%20casc),
[CCTA](/datasets/search/?q=scapis%20ccta),
[lung](/datasets/search/?q=scapis%20lung)) from the six SCAPIS sites.

Once approved by SCAPIS, researchers can download the data through the AIDA Data
Hub [DGX-2 Service](/services#dgx-2), or
[join AIDA](/about/engagements/aida/#join) to process the data using on-platform
compute resources.

The AIDA Data Hub is currently working to establish its
[Data Science Platform](/data-science-platform/) as a 2.0 extension to its
sensitive data services. This is intended to provide long term primary storage
for data driven precision health research, more processing power for on-platform
use, and support for more advanced usage scenarios to a wider range of user
communities. The hardware for the data science platform is currently being
installed, and the system is planned to be sensitive data ready by the end of
2024.
