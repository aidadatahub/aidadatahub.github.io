title: "AIDA Data Hub DSP Now Open for Business"
highlight: yes
blurb: >
  Wednesday April 19, 2025, a momentous day for Sweden, was the day of the successful launch of our [Data Science Platform](/data-science-platform/) &ndash; DSP &ndash; as Sweden's first data science platform truly suited to meet the needs of research and clinical innovation in data driven precision health. It was commemorated with a likewise successful [launch conference](/events/2025-03-19-data-science-platform-launch-party/) with presentations and live demonstrations of platform functionalities to a full visualization theater and online audience of national and international speakers, and representatives from research, industry, caregivers and patient organizations. The Data Science Platform is now [Open for Business](/data-science-platform/).

**Wednesday April 19, 2025, was a momentous day for Sweden, as it marked the date of the successful launch of the AIDA Data Hub [Data Science Platform](/data-science-platform/) &ndash; DSP &ndash; as Sweden's first data science platform that is truly suited to the needs of research and clinical innovation in data driven precision health.**

Medical research often requires handling large amounts of sensitive data, and often takes longer than an election cycle to complete. This means that medical researchers often find themselves needing to store sensitive data for longer than their hardware investors can comfortably guarantee that their data can be safekept. Also, clinical innovation is often highly dependent on excellent features for collaboration to even get off the launch pad.

"The DSP is the first platform in Sweden that combines secure long term primary storage with AI compute, where security measures are customizable to the needs in your research", explains AIDA Data director Joel Hedlund. "The DSP offers a data collaboration platform where these features are combined, and this is what will allow many efforts in medical research and clinical innovation to finally progress at their intended pace. This combination of features is what makes DSP unprecedentedly suited to this very important purpose, to create patient- and clinical benefit, research excellence, public health, and GDP."

The DSP has its beginnings in the AIDA DGX-2 service, which was operated in collaboration with Region Östergötland, in the same secure data centers that host the hospital electronic healthcare record production servers. However, the new system is instead hosted in [NAISS](https://naiss.se) data centers, where the national flagship compute system Arrhenius and the European AI factory Mimer will be built.

"So when extreme needs for computational power arise, the intention is that the users will be able to leverage the massive power of these flagship systems, together with their data that is safekept long term on DSP, providing the best of both worlds", Joel goes on.    

Many platforms are designed with the security concerns of the operators at the forefront, meaning that the operator takes extensive responsibility for the operations, and puts comprehensive security measures in place to deal with almost any threat. However, a one-size-fits-all approach to security can easily create limitations that make valid and valuable research impossible to carry out using the system. In fact, this mindset runs contrary to how responsibilities are laid out in law, where the user is the data controller, and thus by law is responsible for both their activities and for ensuring that the safeguards are suitable for the activities instead of hindering them. In contrast, the DSP is designed with this latter situation in mind.

"Everything is locked down by default, but users can decide to open up as appropriate, so that it becomes possible to carry out their legally approved activities, without affecting other users on the platform. That is the guarantee we offer", clarifies Joel.

The typical DSP customer is a university, and the typical DSP user is a researcher in an ethically approved research project. However, in principle the customer could just as well be a company, or a healthcare provider doing structured quality improvement work according to patient data law.

The DSP is operated based on user fees, and because AIDA Data Hub is part of a public agency, the prices are set so as not to interfere with the free market. However, should these prices lead to higher profits than allowed for a public agency, then discounts will be offered so as to incentivize data sharing and maximizing high impact research.

"Naturally, as the intended output from this system is high impact research; not profit", stresses Joel.
