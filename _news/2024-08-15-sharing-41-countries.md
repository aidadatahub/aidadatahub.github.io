A scant few days ago we shared the [CTPEL](/10.23698/aida/ctpel) Dataset
provided by Chunliang Wang from KTH with researchers in Australia, and today we
were able to effect sharing of the [LNCO](/10.23698/aida/lnco) and
[LNCO2](/10.23698/aida/lnco) datasets provided by Claes Lundström and coworkers
with researchers in Singapore, making Australia and Singapore the 40th and 41st
countries in our data sharing family.

The [CTPEL](/10.23698/aida/ctpel) dataset includes 5 bone segmentation masks and
15 anatomical landmark annotations for pelvis bones in each of 90 CT cases.
These cases were extracted from the CT Lymph Nodes and CT Colonography
collections available in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The CTPEL Dataset
has been shared with 62 researchers so far!

The [LNCO](/10.23698/aida/lnco) and [LNCO2](/10.23698/aida/lnco) datasets
contain whole slide pathology images from regional lymph node metastasis in
colon adenocarcinoma, generated by the Clinical Pathology and Cytology
departments at Region Gävleborg and Region Östergötland. LNCO2 serves as a
second collection series related to the LNCO dataset, utilizing different
collection and annotation parameters.
