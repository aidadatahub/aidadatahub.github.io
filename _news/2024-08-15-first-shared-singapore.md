AIDA Data Hub has just shared [LNCO](/10.23698/aida/lnco) & [LNCO2](/10.23698/aida/lnco)
datasets provided by Claes Lundström and coworkers with researchers in
Singapore. This is the first data we have shared with Singapore. With this
event, we have shared data with AI researchers in 41 countries!

The LNCO and LNCO2 datasets contain whole slide pathology images from regional
lymph node metastasis in colon adenocarcinoma, generated by the Clinical
Pathology and Cytology departments at Region Gävleborg and Region Östergötland.
LNCO2 serves as a second collection series related to the LNCO dataset,
utilizing different collection and annotation parameters.
