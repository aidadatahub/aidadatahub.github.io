**AIDA Data Hub and SCAPIS has established new Data Processing Agreements to cover the usage of the AIDA Data Hub´s Data Science Platform (DSP) to more easily make SCAPIS data available for researchers.**

AIDA Data Hub has helped SCAPIS make the sizable image data available to researchers since 2024 using the older DGX-2 system, and this new Data Processing Agreement enables the usage of the more powerful and modern Data Science Platform (DSP).
