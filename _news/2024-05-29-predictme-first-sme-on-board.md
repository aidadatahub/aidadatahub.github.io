PredictMe is involved in the [AHSA](/about/engagements/asha)
driver project PULMO, and is looking to use the AIDA Data Hub platform also as a
production environment for its commercial activities, delivering AI-driven
analyses of epigenetic data also for other research projects.

This partnership marks the next step in the AIDA Data Hub efforts to broaden the
use of our data science platform to more business cases and sectors.
