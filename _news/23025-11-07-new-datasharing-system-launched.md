**AIDA Data Hub has launched a new digital system to manage sharing of AIDA Data Hub datasets: [REMS](/data/#resource-entitlement-management-system-rems)**.

The new system greatly improves on the management of data sharing applications, making it easier to apply for access to datasets and tracking the progress of your application. The system also enables data owners to more easily manage and track the sharing of their datasets.

Presently, most datasets now use the new system to manage requests, you will find the link to apply for access under the landing page for each dataset.
