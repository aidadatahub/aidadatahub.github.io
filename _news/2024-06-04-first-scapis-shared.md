<b>Today, the first SCAPIS imaging dataset was shared with a researcher through the
AIDA Data Hub. You can now [apply for access](/preview/datasets/scapis) to
SCAPIS imaging data, which is expected to become available for sharing in
August.</b>

The first dataset shared was a small subset of lung CT examinations from 3000
individuals. The sharing was primarily done as a first live verification of
technical and procedural readiness, before transfering the bulk of CT data to
AIDA Data Hub for sharing. The test was successful; the data was successfully
made available to the researcher's compute project on the AIDA Data Hub
[DGX-2 Service](/services#dgx-2) for download or on-platform processing.

Bulk data from 30000 individuals is now being transferred to AIDA Data Hub and
is expected to become available for sharing in August, as 24 datasets,
corresponding to four CT examination types (BODY, CASC, CTCA, LUNG) from the six
SCAPIS sites.
