The AcroSpeech project aims to enable early diagnosis of acromegaly with the help of
novel AI based voice recognition tools.

Acromegaly is a rare disease, caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland
increasing productionen of growth hormone. This causes facial changes but also
voice changes and swelling of soft  tissues. The symptoms are unspecific and
gradual, so therefore many can go on for as long as 10 years before getting a
diagnosis. By that time, many have already developed bodily changes and other
sequelae which may be permanent. Early diagnosis - and treatment - may therefore
be life changing for the patients.

The AIDA Data Hub support function has hitherto been targeted mainly to the AIDA
community in medical imaging diagnostics AI, but is now opening up provide user
fee based support to a greater audience within precision health, and this is the
both first support project outside of medical imaging and the first support
project paid for by user fees. If you are interested in receiving support for
your project you can apply below.
