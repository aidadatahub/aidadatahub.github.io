We have shared [CTPEL](/10.23698/aida/ctpel) Dataset provided by Chunliang Wang
from KTH with researchers in Australia for the first time! Australia is 40th
country we have shared data with! CTPEL includes 5 bone segmentation masks and
15 anatomical landmark annotations for pelvis bones in each of 90 CT cases.
These cases were extracted from the CT Lymph Nodes and CT Colonography
collections available in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The CTPEL Dataset has
been shared with 62 researchers so far!
