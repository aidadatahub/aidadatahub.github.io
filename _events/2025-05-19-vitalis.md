The title of the talk is
[Använda Standardiserade Hälsodata som Accelerator (ASHA) - Säker Forskning och Utveckling](https://invitepeople.com/public/events/bd0a6002b4/seminars/schedule?q=asha).
In this lecture, we present how the AIDA Data Hub capabilities can be leveraged
to implement the ASHA vision, to improve conditions for data driven and precision
oriented research, driving the transition to a more effective and patient
centered healthcare. The presentation will also include concrete examples of
research projects enabled, as illustration.
