Datasets are well-defined sets of data, with associated terms of use. We help researchers share their datasets with the world, on their terms.

Sharing data is seen as a valuable contribution to research. Communities like AIDA can consider contribution of prioritized data as grounds for discounts on membership fees and service costs, or entitlements to other perks. Also, shared datasets do not count toward your storage quota on our data science platform.

When you share your dataset through AIDA Data Hub, we assign it a digital object identifier (DOI) which makes it citeable in research publications. We also help you set up a search engine optimized landing page for the dataset, to make it more findable in normal internet searches, thereby making your dataset more FAIR. The landing page describes the data and the terms of use (cf examples here).

When researchers host datasets for sharing at AIDA Data Hub, we help the researchers process the requests for access, for final decision by the researcher.

If approved, the recipient signs a Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) with the researcher (if needed) and AIDA Data Hub helps effect the data transfer.

Researchers can also delegate the decision making and DSA process (if any) to AIDA Data Hub under a Data Transfer Agreement (DTA).

The AIDA Data Sharing Policy and its practical overview and legal overview are good entrypoints learning more about the general process. You can also contact our data sharing team for further discussion.
