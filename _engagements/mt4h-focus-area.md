In our contribution to the Medtech4Health Focus area Datadriven H채lsa, V책rd och
Omsorg, AIDA Data Hub is working to broaden the use of our
[data science platform](../../../data-science-platform) to more sectors and business models.

For example, AIDA Data Hub is providing a production environment for use by AI
startup company [PredictMe](https://www.predictme.se/) (also invoved in the
[ASHA](../asha) driver project PULMO) to provide AI based analyses of epigenetic
data to other research projects.
