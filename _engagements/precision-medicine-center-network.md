The seven university hospital healthcare regions in Sweden are establishing
precision medicine centra, and have set up a network to collaboratively draw up
the roadmap toward broad implementation in clinical routine. The work is
coordinated by [Region Örebro län](https://www.regionorebrolan.se/). Findings
from the first working meeting were shared in a TT press release:

[Precision medicine is the future healthcare](https://via.tt.se/pressmeddelande/3633893/precisionsmedicin-ar-framtidens-sjukvard?publisherId=3235654&lang=sv) (Swedish)

AIDA and AIDA Data Hub are contributing perspectives from its experiences
operating a national network for AI innovation in medical imaging diagnostics,
and the accompanying e-infrastructure to support it.
