[Arrhenius](https://liu.se/en/news-item/europeisk-superdator-hamnar-pa-liu) is
the planned next flagship academic compute system in Sweden. It is to be operated
by [NAISS](https://naiss.se) and be part of [EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/index_en).
It will have the capability to process sensitive data for research.

AIDA Data Hub is participating in the procurement group for the Arrhenius
sensitive data capability, contributing perspective from processing medical imaging
diagnostics data for AI research, and systems administrator perspective from
operating a national compute resource for this purpose, namely the
[AIDA Data Hub DGX-2 Service](/services#dgx-2).

In parallel, AIDA Data Hub is setting up its
[data science platform](../../../data-science-platform), close to Arrhenius and
other [NAISS](https://naiss.se)/[NSC](https://www.nsc.liu.se) systems and
co-located with a [Bigpicture](../bigpicture) Federated node and a data collaboration
platform for [EUCAIM](../eucaim).
