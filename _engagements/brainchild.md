[BrainChild](https://barncancerfonden.se/brainchild/) is a project initiated by
the Swedish Childhood Cancer Fund, aiming to investigate the possibility of a
centralized data platform to analyze and share childhood cancer data with
researchers and clinicians all over the world.

AIDA Data Hub has contributed to the platform design stage of the project, and
will provide data collaboration spaces on its
[data science platform](../../../data-science-platform) for two of the pilot
projects that have been set up to help drive implementation of the platform.
