[GLIOMATCH](https://gliomatch.eu/) is a Horizon Europe project in research and
innovation for improving the clinical outcome of malignant brain tumours in
adults and children with tailored immunotherapy treatments.

Adult glioblastoma (GBM) and pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG, including
diffuse midline gliomas) are highly malignant, intrinsically resistant and
inevitably recurring brain tumours with dismal prognosis despite intensive
treatment. The GLIOMATCH project aims at improving the clinical outcome of GBM/pHGG
patients by enabling immunology-based patient stratification to empower
personalised matching of appropriate existing/novel immunotherapy strategies,
while improving follow-up of clinical responses to existing/novel therapeutics.

This will be achieved by integrating spatially resolved, multi-layered tissue
maps (using integrated spatially resolved single-cell multiomics combining
RNA/protein/(epi)genome insights) with non-invasive MRI images into a novel MRI
radio-multiomics hub. This hub will revolutionise the clinical care of GBM/pHGG
patients by providing an accessible and scalable tumour-host based patient
stratification tool for personalised therapy matching, while enabling
longitudinal follow-up to estimate (early) treatment efficacy or adverse effects.

AIDA Data Hub supports the Swedish contributions to GLIOMATCH by providing data
collaboration spaces on its [data science platform](../../../data-science-platform)
to facilitate national data collection and harmonisation.
