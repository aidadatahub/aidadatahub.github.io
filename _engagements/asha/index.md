*ASHA is a backronym for "Använda Standardiserade Hälsodata som Accelerator", which also happens to mean "Health" in Swahili.*

[ASHA](https://www.vinnova.se/p/anvanda-standardiserade-halsodata-som-accelerator-for-att-starka-innovation-och-framtidens-halso--och-sjukvard/)
is a VINNOVA sytems demonstrator that aims to leverage open standards for
electronics health records ([openEHR](https://openehr.org/)) to build
interoperable health data spaces for primary and secondary use, to increase use
of health data for accelerated innovation and development.

The AIDA Data Hub contribution to ASHA is to provide a health data spaces for
secondary use on its [data science platform](../../../data-science-platform),
co-located with a [Bigpicture](../bigpicture) Federated node and a data
collaboration platform for [EUCAIM](../eucaim) use cases, close to national and
European high-performance compute systems like [Arrhenius](../arrhenius).

One such health data space will be used by the ASHA subproject
[PULMO](https://liu.se/forskning/forstarkning-av-immunforsvaret-for-att-forebygga-tuberkulos/pulmo)
to combine and analyse genetic, microbiome and epigenetic data from
[SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se) facilities with health records exported for
research from healthcare, to produce AI based diagnostics tools for complex
multi-systemic diseases like long covid, tuberculosis and other pulmonary
conditions.
