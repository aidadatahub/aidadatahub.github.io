The Swedish Cardiopulmonary Bioimage Study ([SCAPIS](https://scapis.org)) is a nationwide,
open-access, population-based cohort for the study of cardiovascular disease and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The AIDA Data Hub [DGX-2 Service](/services#dgx-2) hosts the AIDA-SCAPIS data
lab, which enables researchers to analyse and train AI using SCAPIS imaging data
using on-platform compute resources.

The full set of SCAPIS computed tomography imaging data is currently being
transferred to the AIDA Data Hub for sharing and on-platform analysis. The first
dataset has been [successfully shared](../../../news/2024-06-04-first-scapis-shared),
and researchers are welcome to apply for [access](../../../datasets/scapis#access).
