This project aims to develop a strategy for developing region common management
of healthcare data, on assignment from the board of the system of healthcare knowledge
steering (SKS) and the national cooperation group health data (NSG HD). The
project is coordingated by Sveriges Regioner och Kommuner (SKR).

[Strategi för effektivare hantering av vårddata](https://kunskapsstyrningvard.se/kunskapsstyrningvard/programomradenochsamverkansgrupper/nationellasamverkansgrupper/nsghalsodata/strategiforeffektivarehanteringavvarddata.82634.html)

The healthcare regions in Sweden are currently collecting large volumnes of data
in order to steer, lead, and develop the operations. National agencies are
depending on this data for carrying out their missions, as are the research
communities and the national quality registers.

Differences in how specifications are interpreted and complied with make it hard
to carry out overarching analyses on a national level. Many registers overlap,
and the same data is collected multiple times, making this data handling task
demanding for the regions.

The purpose of the strategy delivered by this project is to ensure access to
high quality health data for secondary use, to enable increased use of
healthcare data, and contribute to more efficient handling. The strategy should
contribute to healthcare region ability to comply with European Health Data Space
law (EHDS).

AIDA Data Hub participates in the project reference group with experiences from
operating infrastructure for data standardization and sharing.
