Cancer Image Europe ([EUCAIM](https://cancerimage.eu/)) is pioneering a
pan-European federated infrastructure for cancer images, fueling AI innovations.

The AIDA Data Hub contribution to EUCAIM is to provide a data collaboration
platform for EUCAIM, co-located with a Bigpicture Federated node on its
[data science platform](../../../data-science-platform), close to national and
European high-performance compute systems. The intention is to EUCAIM use cases and at
the same time, in a very hands-on fashion, ensure compatibility between EUCAIM,
Bigpicture, GDI and Federated EGA technologies.

One of the use cases to be supported by this data collaboration platform was
submitted by researchers at [CMIV](https://liu.se/cmiv), and concerns
investigation of novel uses of photon counting comuted tomography (PCCT) in liver
cancer care, in combination with data from genetics and pathology imaging.
