description: Data and services for innovation in data driven precision health
---
We are a national e-infrastructure for research and clinical innovation in data
driven precision health, with a base in multi-modal diagnostics and medical
imaging AI. We offer data, services, compute and storage resources, and advanced
support to researchers, industry, and caregivers of national significance.

Hosted by the [Link√∂ping University](https://liu.se)
Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization ([CMIV](https://liu.se/cmiv)).
Part of [SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se) Bioinformatics Platform ([NBIS](https://nbis.se)).
Reporting to the Analytic Imaging Diagnostics Arena ([AIDA](/about/aida)) Steering Group
and [SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se) Board.

## Data
We help researchers share their data with the world, making high-quality
datasets more [FAIR](/metrics#fair) and citeable using digital object identifiers
([DOI](/about#what-are-dois-and-dataset-registers)). We also fund work with
extracting and enriching prioritized data for research.
