## Overview of AIDA data sharing

This section provides entry points to the practical aspects of AIDA data sharing, at every step going from research idea to sharing data with the greater research community, and highlighting where AIDA can help.

AIDA can offer some support to non-members in steps 2-5 below <span class="aida-data-sharing-overview-nonmember">(blue)</span>, but membership is required for major support and from step 6 on <span class="aida-data-sharing-overview-member">(green)</span>.

    <a href="../policy/#getting-access">Several ways exist</a>. Sharing prioritized data on the data hub is one way.
</td></tr>
<tr class="nonmember"><td></td><td id="ethical-review-application"><b>Ethical review application</b><br/>  
    Apply to <a href="https://etikprovningsmyndigheten.se/">EPM</a> for ethical review. Include <a href="../context/#ethics-and-protective-measures-in-research-on-clinical-data">data sharing aspects</a>. AIDA can <a href="../ethics/">help you</a>.

<tr class="nonmember"><td></td><td id="get-research-data"><b>Get research data</b><br/>  
    Use your ethical approval to get data from caregivers and other data sources. Before disclosing data, these will assess if disclosure will lead to harm ("menpr√∂vning"). <a href="../context/#appropriate-technical-and-organizational-protective-measures">Pseudonymize and protect your data</a>. AIDA offers <a href="../policy/#tools-for-large-scale-data-exports">support, tools</a> and <a href="https://datahub.aida.scilifelab.se/datasets">data</a>.

    Contact an <a href="mailto:aida-data-director@medtech4health.se">AIDA system administrator</a> to upload data to the AIDA platform. You can use the <a href="../policy/#aida-pacs">AIDA PACS</a> to visually inspect your data. Only you can see your data.

    AIDA members you <a href="../policy/#selective-sharing">selectively share</a> with can see your data. An <a href="mailto:aida-data-director@medtech4health.se">AIDA system administrator</a> can make a working copy for download or more advanced analyses. You will be notified of this, or asked to approve if you have explicitly requested this.
</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td id="data-hub-sharing"><b>Data hub sharing?</b><br/>  
    AIDA encourages <a href="../policy/#aida-data-hub-sharing">data hub sharing</a>. AIDA <a href="../policy/#aida-dataset-register">advertises shared datasets</a>, and makes them <a href="../policy/#visibility-citability-and-digital-object-identifiers">citable in research</a> using DOIs.

    AIDA promotes the <a href="../policy/#aida-by-license">AIDA BY license</a> which allows use within AIDA.</p>
    <b>Full or sample data hub sharing?</b><br/>

    You can either handle access requests yourself, or delegate handling to AIDA.
    AIDA will notify you of access requests, can <a href="../policy/#facilitating-data-sharing-outside-of-aida">facilitate contacts</a> with requesters, and can facilitate transfers based on your instructions. You can use AIDA <a href="../templates/">templates</a> as a starting point for setting up data sharing agreements outside of AIDA. If you prefer to delegate handling to AIDA, you can sign a Data Transfer Agreement with AIDA to specify how sharing is to be carried out.
