The AcroFace project aims to enable early diagnosis of acromegaly with the help of novel AI based face analysis tools.

Acromegaly is a rare disease, caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland increasing productionen of growth hormone. This causes facial changes but also voice changes and swelling of soft tissues. The symptoms are unspecific and gradual, so therefore many can go on for as long as 10 years before getting a diagnosis. By that time, many have already developed bodily changes and other sequelae which may be permanent. Early diagnosis - and treatment - may therefore be life changing for the patients.

In this project the AIDA Data Hub has assisted with training the AI models used for image recognition to classify face images into either the diagnosis acromegaly or as a control.
