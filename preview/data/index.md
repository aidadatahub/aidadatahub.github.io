title: Data Access
description: AIDA Data Hub increasing availability of data for research.
---
We help researchers share their data with the world, making high-quality
datasets more [FAIR](/metrics#fair) and citeable using digital object identifiers
([DOI](/about#what-are-dois-and-dataset-registers)). We also fund work with
extracting and enriching prioritized data for research.

## Datasets

* [Browse](../datasets)
* [Search](/search)
* [API](/api)

## Access
Each dataset landing page contains instructions for access (cf examples [here](../datasets)).

We help researchers share their datasets with the world, on their terms.
Datasets are well-defined sets of data, with associated terms of use. The
landing page for each dataset describe the data and terms of use.

When researchers host datasets for sharing at AIDA Data Hub, we help the
researchers process the access requests, for final decision by the researcher.

If approved, the recipient signs a Data Sharing Agreement ([DSA](/sharing/templates))
with the researcher (if needed), and AIDA Data Hub helps effect the data transfer.

Researchers can also delegate the decision making and DSA process (if needed)
to AIDA Data Hub under a Data Transfer Agreement ([DTA](/sharing/templates)).

Please refer to each dataset landing page for terms of use and instructions
for access.
