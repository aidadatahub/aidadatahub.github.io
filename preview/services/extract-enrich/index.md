title: Extract and enrich
description: Increasing access to prioritized data for research
---
We engage with data providers to collect training data for those data driven
tools for precision health that will best meet the needs of current and future
clinical practice.

The priorities for data acquisition are continuously set by the
[AIDA clinical council](https://medtech4health.se/aida/organisation/) based on
current data hub composition and identified clinical needs.

The AIDA Data Hub can fund work with extracting [prioritized data](#priorities)
for sharing on the AIDA Data Hub. Please contact the [data sharing team](#contact)
for proposals for data extraction, or to suggest further data acquisition topics.
