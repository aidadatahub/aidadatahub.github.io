title: Data Sharing
description: Share your datasets with the world.
---
We help researchers share their data with the world, making high-quality
datasets more [FAIR](/metrics#fair) and citeable using digital object identifiers
([DOI](/about/fair#what-are-dois-and-dataset-registers)). Benefits include:
* More research collaborations
* More citations
* Higher impact
* More data availabile for research
* Discounts
* Perks
* And more, read on below

## How does it work?
Datasets are well-defined sets of data, with associated terms of use.
We help researchers share their datasets with the world, on their terms.

Sharing data is seen as a valuable contribution to research. Communities like
[AIDA](../../about/aida) can consider contribution of [prioritized data](../extract-enrich#prio)
as grounds for discounts on membership fees and service costs, or entitlements
to other perks. Also, shared datasets do not count toward your storage
quota on our [data science platform](../data-science-platform).

When you share your dataset through AIDA Data Hub, we assign it a digital object
identifier ([DOI](/about/fair#what-are-dois-and-dataset-registers)) which makes it
citeable in research publications. We also help you set up a search engine
optimized landing page for the dataset, to make it more findable in normal
internet searches, thereby making your dataset more [FAIR](/metrics#fair). The
landing page describes the data and the terms of use (cf examples [here](../datasets)).

When researchers host datasets for sharing at AIDA Data Hub, we help the
researchers process the requests for access, for final decision by the researcher.

If approved, the recipient signs a Data Sharing Agreement ([DSA](/sharing/templates))
with the researcher (if needed) and AIDA Data Hub helps effect the data transfer.

Researchers can also delegate the decision making and DSA process (if any)
to AIDA Data Hub under a Data Transfer Agreement ([DTA](/sharing/templates)).

The [AIDA Data Sharing Policy](/sharing) and its [practical overview](/sharing/overview)
and [legal overview](/sharing/context#common-practice) are good entrypoints
learning more about the general process. You can also contact
[our data sharing team](#contact)  for further discussion.
