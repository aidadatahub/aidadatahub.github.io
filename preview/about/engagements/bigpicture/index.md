[Bigpicture](https://bigpicture.eu/) is building a central repository of digital
pathology slides to boost the development of artificial intelligence

The AIDA Data Hub leads development of the central repository, which is carried
out together with system development teams at the ELIXIR nodes in Finland
([CSC](https:/csc.fi)) and Sweden ([NBIS](https://nbis.se)).

AIDA Data Hub is also setting up a Bigpicture Federated node on its
[data science platform](../../../data-science-platform), close to national and
European high-performance compute systems, and co-located with a data collaboration
platform for EUCAIM. The intention is to support EUCAIM use cases, and at
the same time in a very hands-on fashion ensure compatibility between EUCAIM,
Bigpicture, GDI and Federated EGA technologies.
