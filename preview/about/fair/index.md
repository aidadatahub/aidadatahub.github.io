title: AIDA Data Hub FAIR data
---
## What are DOIs and dataset registers?<span id="doi"/>
The AIDA Data Hub facilitates sharing datasets for machine learning in medical
image diagnostics. AIDA uses
Digital Object Identifiers ([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) to increase exposure
and impact of the shared datasets. These DOIs help make the datasets more findable,
accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/)).

Example: 10.23698/aida/ctpa &rarr;
[https://doi.org/10.23698/aida/ctpa](https://doi.org/10.23698/aida/ctpa)

Thanks to the global [DOI system](https://doi.org/), following a link to a DOI
will always take you the official landing page with the latest updated official
information on that dataset.

AIDA has its own [DOI prefix](https://search.datacite.org/works?query=snd.aida)
provided by [DataCite](https://datacite.org) through the
Swedish National Data Service ([SND](https://snd.gu.se/en)).
The AIDA Data Hub and its datasets are discoverable through the global
[re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org) registry of research data repositories:

You can [find us](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100013031) and other
data sources relevant to your research if you
[browse by subject](https://www.re3data.org/browse/by-subject/), for example:
