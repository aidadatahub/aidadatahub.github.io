## Data
We help researchers share their data with the world, making high-quality
datasets more [FAIR](/metrics#fair) and citeable using digital object identifiers
([DOI](/about#what-are-dois-and-dataset-registers)). We also fund work with
extracting and enriching prioritized data for research.

## AIDA Data Sharing Policy
Everything is easier if you do it "the normal way".

The [AIDA data sharing policy](/sharing) is a comprehensive resource that
describes not only data sharing processes in AIDA, but also common practice in
handling and sharing medical imaging data for research in Sweden and similar
countries. It provides concrete guidelines and examples, and relates them to
original sources in official law text. Key insights have been published in
[Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00674-0)
(OpenAccess).

## AIDA Support

We offer  [Advanced support and training](/support) to the AIDA community, in medical imaging
diagnostics AI research and innovation. Areas include [Research support expertise](/support#research-support-expertise), [Data sharing and policy](/support#data-sharing-policy), and [System design](/support#system-design) for sensitive data.
The goal is to accelerate research within medical imaging diagnostics by supporting researchers from the early phases such as project scoping and modeling
to later practical stages such as debugging, optimizing and deploying AI solutions.

## AIDA Services
We offer leading edge [Services](/services) to researchers in Swedish medical imaging AI.

* [AIDA DGX-2 Service](/services#dgx-2) - Compute system for AI training on sensitive personal data.
* [AIDA Nextcloud](/services#nextcloud) - Research data sharing.
* [AIDA PACS](/services#pacs) - Production grade clinical picture archive and communication system.
* [AIDA Wiki](/services#wiki) - Documentation.
* [AIDA GitHub](/services#github) - Code collaboration.
* [AIDA Chat](/services#chat) - Support and discussion.

These services are offered to AIDA partners. Any Swedish organization active in
AI or medical imaging diagnostics can [join AIDA](/about/aida#join).
