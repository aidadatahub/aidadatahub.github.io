This site facilitates [data sharing](../sharing/) by providing information
on [datasets](/datasets) shared on the [AIDA data hub](/) through search engine
optimized [DOI landing pages](#doi), and also in machine-readable form through
an [API](api/). This site also describes our [services](/services) and
[policies](/sharing).

## What are DOIs and dataset registers? <span id="doi"/>
The AIDA data hub facilitates sharing datasets for machine learning in medical
image diagnostics. AIDA uses
Digital Object Identifiers ([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) to increase exposure
and impact of the shared datasets. These DOIs help make the datasets more findable,
accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/)).

Example: 10.23698/aida/ctpa &rarr;
[https://doi.org/10.23698/aida/ctpa](https://doi.org/10.23698/aida/ctpa)

Thanks to the global [DOI system](https://doi.org/), following a link to a DOI
will always take you the official landing page with the latest updated official
information on that dataset.

AIDA has its own [DOI prefix](https://search.datacite.org/works?query=snd.aida)
provided by [DataCite](https://datacite.org) through the
Swedish National Data Service ([SND](https://snd.gu.se/en)).
The AIDA data hub and its datasets are discoverable through the global
[re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org) registry of research data repositories:
