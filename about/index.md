title: "About This Site"
---
This site facilitates [AIDA data sharing](../sharing/) by providing information
on datasets shared on the [AIDA data hub](https://medtech4health.se/aida/datahub/)
through search engine optimized DOI landing pages, and also in machine-readable
form through an [API](api/).

## Feedback
Please report any errors on this website to our GitHub Pages
[issue tracker](https://github.com/aidadatahub/aidadatahub.github.io/issues),
or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/aidadatahub/aidadatahub.github.io/pulls).

For questions regarding data or the AIDA data hub please contact the
[AIDA data director](mailto:aida-data-director@medtech4health.se).

For all other inquiries about please contact [AIDA](mailto:aida-director@medtech4health.se).

## What are DOIs and dataset registers?
The AIDA data hub facilitates sharing datasets for machine learning in medical
image diagnostics. AIDA uses
Digital Object Identifiers ([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) to increase exposure
and impact of the shared datasets. These DOIs help make the datasets more findable,
accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/)).

Example: 10.23698/aida/ctpa &rarr;
[https://doi.org/10.23698/aida/ctpa](https://doi.org/10.23698/aida/ctpa)

Thanks to the global [DOI system](https://doi.org/), following a link to a DOI
will always take you the official landing page with the latest updated official
information on that dataset.

AIDA has its own [DOI prefix](https://search.datacite.org/works?query=snd.aida)
provided by [DataCite](https://datacite.org) through the
Swedish National Data Service ([SND](https://snd.gu.se/en)).
The AIDA data hub and its datasets are discoverable through the global
[re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org) registry of research data repositories:

You can [find us](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100013031) and other
data sources relevant to your research if you
[browse by subject](https://www.re3data.org/browse/by-subject/), for example:

* [Radiology and Nuclear Medicine](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&subjects%5B%5D=20530%20Radiology%20and%20Nuclear%20Medicine)
* [Pathology and Forensic Medicine](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&subjects%5B%5D=20506%20Pathology%20and%20Forensic%20Medicine)
* [Artificial Intelligence, Image and Language Processing](https://www.re3data.org/search?subjects[]=40904%20Artificial%20Intelligence,%20Image%20and%20Language%20Processing).

## Access and privacy
AIDA is a collaboration arena for academia, industry and healthcare and supports OpenScience and [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). AIDA can facilitate large scale data exports for research from clinical production systems, and can host research data for sharing. AIDA uses data mainly from medical imaging, and therefore has an obligation to adequately safeguard the privacy of the individuals concerned. Therefore AIDA only shares data that is ethically approved for sharing, and when a contractual agreement is in place that includes non-disclosure of data, such AIDA partner contracts for [innovation projects](https://medtech4health.se/aida/ansok-om-innovationsprojekt/), [clinical-](https://medtech4health.se/aida/ansok-klinisk-fellow/) or [technical fellowships](https://medtech4health.se/aida/ansok-om-teknisk-fellow/), [on-site development projects](https://medtech4health.se/aida/ansok-om-pa-plats-utveckling/), or [network partnerships](https://medtech4health.se/aida/partnerskap/). AIDA also facilitates contacts with data controllers for datasets shared on AIDA for data sharing options outside of AIDA.
