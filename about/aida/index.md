Analytic Imaging Diagnostics Arena ([AIDA](https://medtech4health.se/aida)) is a
Swedish publicly funded arena for research and innovation on artificial
intelligence, AI, for medical image analysis. Here, academia, healthcare and
industry meet to translate technical advances in AI technology into patient
benefit in the form of clinically useful tools.

AIDA is [organized](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-en-2/aida-organization/)
as a collaboration arena, currently engaging
[~35 partners](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-en-2/aida-organization/),
from academia, industry and healthcare. AIDA is coordinated by the
[Link√∂ping University](https://liu.se)
[Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization](https://liu.se/cmiv) (CMIV)
and is driven by clinical needs.

AIDA Activities include:
* [Research & innovation projects](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-en-2/innovation-projects/)
* [Clinical evaluations](https://medtech4health.se/en/clinical-evaluations/)
* [Fellowships](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-en-2/15836-2/)
* [Data, compute & storage services](/) &larr; This is the [AIDA Data Hub](/)!
* [AIDA Days](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-en-2/) ~8 Workshops per year
* [Training](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-en-2/)
* [Network partnerships](https://medtech4health.se/aida-en/network-partner/)

AIDA is an initiative within the Strategic innovation program
[Medtech4Health](https://medtech4health.se), jointly supported by
[VINNOVA](https://vinnova.se), [Formas](https://formas.se) and the
[Swedish Energy Agency](https://www.energimyndigheten.se/).

## Join AIDA {#join}
All Swedish organizations active in medical imaging diagnostics or AI are
invited to become a member of AIDA.

This can for example take the form of a
1. [AIDA Innovation project](https://medtech4health.se/apply-for-innovation-project/)
2. [AIDA Clinical evaluation](https://medtech4health.se/en/apply-for-clinical-evaluation/)
3. [AIDA Fellowship](https://medtech4health.se/apply-for-clinical-fellowship/)
4. [AIDA Network partnership](https://medtech4health.se/aida-en/network-partner/)

The first three options entail receiving funding through AIDA. The fourth option
entails paying a very small membersip fee of 10 KSEK/year, or contributing to
AIDA by other means such as [sharing data through the AIDA Data Hub](/datasets),
thereby demonstrating that a meaningful commitment has been made.

Please [contact AIDA](mailto:aida@nbis.se) to discuss ways forward!
