of the [AIDA Data Hub](/).

## Working with DICOM<span id="dicom"/>
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
([DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/))
is the international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process, and
display medical imaging information. It is prevalent in
[radiology](/search/?q=Subject:Radiology) and is gaining traction also in
[pathology](/search/?q=Subject:Pathology).


Some [datasets](/datasets) on the [AIDA Data Hub](/) are provided in DICOM format.
In DICOM, data is provided in nested and interlinking structures, which can be
nontrivial for newcomers to the field to navigate.

For an introduction to how one can work with DICOM data, AIDA is providing a
Jupyter notebook, which is publicly available through the
[SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/)/[NBIS](https://nbis.se/)
