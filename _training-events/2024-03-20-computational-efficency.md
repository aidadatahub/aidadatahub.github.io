  Workshop on profiling for computation efficiency
---

{% include training-event-header.md %}

Efficiency is key in AI development. Performance bottlenecks can increase the training time by orders of magnitude. In this workshop, our focus will be on addressing common problems with computational performance of AI pipelines, in particular how to deal with data loading bottlenecks. Through this session, we will explore tools to profile python code, how to find computational bottlenecks as well as implementing strategies for improvement.
