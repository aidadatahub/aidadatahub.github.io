  Workshop on Graph Neural Networks and geometric deep learning for digital pathology

{% include training-event-header.md %}


One of the major new developments in deep learning is that of Geometric Deep learning, a framework which unifies many of the common successful neural networks under a geometric umbrella. 
In this workshop weâ€™ll give a concise overview of Geometric Deep Learning with a focus on what Graph Neural Networks are and how they can be practically applied using the Pytorch Geometric framework. As an example application, we will use Graph Neural Networks to classify cell graphs extracted from whole slide images for digital pathology.
