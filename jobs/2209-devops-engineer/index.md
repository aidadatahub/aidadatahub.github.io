Linköping University hereby advertises a position as Research engineer in
Service development and operations at AIDA Data Hub, belonging to the Department
of Science and Technology, based at the Center for Medical Image Science and
Visualization (CMIV), Linköping University Hospital.

The AIDA Data Hub [research context](#research-context) within CMIV, AIDA,
SciLifeLab, and Bigpicture is described separately below.

### Topic for the position
A crucial requirement for development of cutting edge AI solutions is to have
access to massive amounts of well-organized training data, which in the case of
[AIDA](https://medtech4health.se/aida) refers to medical images and related
clinical data. The [AIDA Data Hub](https://datahub.aida.scilifelab.se) works to
increase availability of such data, for example by developing, integrating and
operating cutting-edge secure and reliable services for processing and sharing
sensitive personal data for research in collaboration with leading actors in
Europe. AIDA and the AIDA Data Hub are in rapid expansion through data streams
from national and international clinical sources, with strong synergies with
developments in European initiatives such as Bigpicture.

### Duties
The research engineer will be part of the AIDA Data Hub Scrum team, which is
tasked with developing and operating services at the AIDA Data Hub, Bigpicture,
and related efforts, and will collaborate closely with other national and
international scrum teams to develop cutting-edge services for sensitive
personal data for research. The position will also include dialogue with users
and other stakeholders from academic institutions, companies and care providers,
within and outside of Sweden.

A heavy focus will be on developing and operating services using cloud
technologies that are in current widespread use, such as OpenStack, S3,
Terraform, and Kubernetes, and on software development mostly in golang.
Development and operation of some self-hosted services are also in scope, as is
some software development in other programming languages such as Python.

### Qualifications
The position requires a Bachelor of Science degree or similar, in a computer
science subject.

Professional experience in the IT domain, from industry, academia, and/or
healthcare, is a very important factor in judging candidates. It is a strong
merit to have experience from operating infrastructure services in secured or
air-gapped environments. Experience from cross-functional and distributed
development work in international teams is also meriting. Experience from
research operations in a data-intensive computer science domain, and in
particular work with analysis of large-scale biomedical data is a merit for this
position, as is experience from AI applications.

The candidate should demonstrate skills in technical administration and
management of IT services and applications.

The position requires excellent communication abilities, both spoken and
written, in the English language. Such abilities also in the Swedish language
are considered a very strong merit
