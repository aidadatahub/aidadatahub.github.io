Linköping University hereby advertises a position as Research engineer in Data
sharing at the AIDA Data Hub, belonging to the Department of Science and
Technology, based at the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization
(CMIV), Linköping University Hospital.

The AIDA Data Hub [research context](#research-context) within CMIV, AIDA, and
SciLifeLab is described separately below.

### Topic for the position
The [AIDA arena](https://medtech4health.se/aida) facilitates collaboration
between national stakeholders in medical imaging AI, to accelerate development
and use of world leading AI tools. A crucial requirement for success is access
to massive amounts of well-organized training data, which in the case of AIDA is
referring to medical images and related clinical data. The [AIDA Data
Hub](https://datahub.aida.scilifelab.se) works to increase availability of such
data, by engaging with caregivers to facilitate data extraction for research,
and with leading research groups to facilitate data sharing and reuse, and with
decision makers to develop clear guidelines and best practices to facilitate
ethical and legal data sharing and scientific activities. The AIDA Data Hub is
under rapid expansion through data streams from clinical sources across Sweden
and Europe. The topic includes a wide range of aspects with respect to amassing
the data and, in addition, the broad efforts needed to make the data and the
supporting systems ready for effective AI training. The AIDA arena is under
evolution to a broader national coverage, as well as towards a pan-European
reach, with strong synergies with developments in European flagship projects in
medical imaging and AI.

### Duties
The research engineer will be central for running and developing the data hub
operations. A key duty is to make the data services attractive and effective for
AI researchers, through operation of secure and reliable services for sharing of
medical data for research, and in managing agreement processes with a diverse
range of stakeholders both in extension of the AIDA network and in data sharing
between research groups and healthcare organizations. Organization of workshops
and other events that strengthen the effectiveness of the AIDA collaboration
arena will also be part of the core work tasks. The position comprises close
collaboration with expertise from different organizations, academic
institutions, companies and care providers, within and outside of Sweden.

A heavy focus will be the national AIDA Data Hub services, both in terms of
system administration and continued development. It will also be essential to
build data extraction processes that minimize efforts among the healthcare
providers. The duties include addressing challenges of many types, primarily
technical, but also legal questions and integrity considerations.

### Qualifications
The position requires a Bachelor of Science degree or similar, in a computer- or
life science subject.

Professional experience in the IT domain, from industry, academia, and/or
healthcare, is a very important factor in judging candidates. Experience from
research operations in a data-intensive computer science domain is considered a
strong merit, in particular work with large-scale data. Experience from
biomedical data is a merit for this position, as is experience from AI
applications. It is a merit to have experience from cross-functional and
distributed development work, with most weight given to experience from running
infrastructure services for research purposes, and international collaborations.

The candidate should demonstrate skills in technical administration and
management of IT services, as well as ability to manage complex efforts.

The position requires excellent communication abilities, both spoken and
written, in the English language. Such abilities also in the Swedish language
are considered a very strong merit.
