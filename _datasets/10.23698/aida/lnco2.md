  annotation: |
    Lymph nodes have been identified by an experienced pathologist and annotated
    using region-of-interest boxes (positive, negative, unassested). A few detailed polygons of tumor exist. See details below.

## Annotation details

### Labels

The following labels exists:

- roi_lgl_norm:: Region contains a lymph node section that do not contain tumor-positive areas, eg, is normal or negative. (but see also note below)

- roi_lgl_unknown:: Region contains a lymph node for which ground truth has not been established.

- roi_lgl_tumor:: Region contains a lymph node where at least some areas are tumor-positive areas. (Might not be annotated)

- roi_lgl_exclude:: Contains lymph node that was determined to be of poor quality or contain severe artifacts from scanning. Would be excluded from clinial review (not suitable).

- roi_tumor:: Region mostly contains positive pixels, but not guaranteed that all pixels are positive.

- excl & excl_artifact:: these areas should be substracted from tumor-annotated regions to gain pure-tumor pixels.

- bkg: region contains only background pixels

NOTE: `roi_tumor` annotations are not exhaustive, meaning, there might be more tumor areas in `lgl_roi_tumor` lymph nodes than annotated with `roi_tumor` annotations.

NOTE: Some `roi_lgl_norm` areas contain tumor cells that are from an accidental contamination of the glass during processing. This is normal during routine clinical work and a challenge that automated systems should deal with in an appropriate manner. This is a very easy task for human pathologists to discern.

### Sampling procedure

Sampling procedure: Query for patients with confirmed adenocarcinomas that underwent colorectomy with subsequent lymphnode review as part of TNM-staging. Selected 50 chronologically consecutive cases from unique patients (no patient has more than one case).

Source: One medical clinic in Sweden. Same as for LNCO1.
