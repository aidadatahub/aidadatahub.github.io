  description: |
    This dataset consists of 174 WSI ovary whole slide images (WSI): 158
    malignant and 16 benign. Eight of the most common, histological definable
    tumour types were annotated: high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), low grade
    serous carcinoma (LGSC), clear cell carcinoma (CC), endometrioid
    adenocarcinoma (EN), metastastic serous carcinoma (MS), metastatic other
    (MO), serous borderline tumor (SB) and mucinous borderline tumor (MB). Also
    normal ovarian tissue were annotated. 2402 separate annotations were made.
    For the benign structures only the epithelial structures, stroma and support
    tissue were annotated.

    One physician was responsible for the manual annotations controlled by a second
    pathologist.

    Eight of the most common, histological definable tumour types were
    annotated: high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), low grade serous carcinoma
    (LGSC), clear cell carcinoma (CC), endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EN),
    metastastic serous carcinoma (MS), metastatic other (MO), serous borderline
    tumor (SB) and mucinous borderline tumor (MB). Also normal ovarian tissue
    was annotated. In total 2402 separate annotations were made. For the
    benign structures only the epithelial structures, stroma and support tissue
    were annotated.

### Pixel position scaling
Coordinates given are relative to the image *width*. To get the correct pixel
position, X coordinates (and Y coordinates!) should therefore be multiplied with
the image *width*.
