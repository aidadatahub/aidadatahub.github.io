  description: |
    The data contains 300 skulls. The data is divided into three groups with 100
    scans in three categories Females, Males, and Mix. The purpose of the
    project was to generate a machine learning algorithm to be able reconstruct
    missing parts of the skull for cranioplasty. Each scan was verified to
    ensure normal skull shape. To ensure data privacy the faces have
    been deblurred with an in-house developed algorithm.

  annotation: |
    There are no annotations performed on the data set as segmentation of the
    skull shape is trivial by use of thresholding. All annotation in the
    project was fully automated.
