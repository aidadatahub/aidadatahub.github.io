  description: |
    Atypical femoral fracture is a well-documented adverse reaction to
    bisphosphonate treatment, but may also have other causes. This dataset contains 433
    radiographs from 149 patients with complete AFF, and 549 radiographs from
    224 patients with normal femur fractures. There are no diagnoses of cancer,
    to reduce the risk of confounding by indication.

  annotation: |
    Atypical femoral fractures have a characteristic fracture pattern with the
    fracture running perpendicular  to the longitudinal axis of the femur. The
    periosteal surface shows a focal cortical thickening (attempts to heal the
    fracture) and the fracture extends medially through unaffected cortical bone
    with a typical medial spike. These three radiographic signs are very typical
    findings for all kinds of stress fractures in cortical bone.

    Each case including radiographs was evaluated by at least one senior
    consultant in orthopedics, and categorized into atypical femoral fractures
    (AFF) and normal fractures of the femoral shaft (NFF).
