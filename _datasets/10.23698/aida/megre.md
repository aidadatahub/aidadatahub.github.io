  description: |
    Multi-echo gradient echo (MEGRE) MRI data with 8 different echo times
    (2.38-23.6 ms) from 326 + 40 prostate cancer patients with gold fiducial
    markers inserted into the prostate (train/validation + test dataset).
    A scientific paper that utilizes this dataset for deep learning has been
    [published](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb0f9).
    Underlying description of the technique and its first use has been described
    in a [previous publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28803447).

    The data contains an image volume for each patient, for each echo time. The
    center of mass from the three inserted prostate gold fiducial markers was
    manually defined. The ground truth label for this dataset consist of
    spherical objects with a radius of 1-12 mm, inserted in the center of mass
    defined locations. Method in the paper uses 9 mm radius.

  annotation: |
    For 100 out of the 326 patients in the train/validation dataset the MEGRE
    images were annotated in MATLAB where the center of mass (CoM) coordinates of
    the gold fiducial marker signal voids were defined by one observer. For the
    remaining 226 of the patients in the train/validation dataset and the 40
    patients in the test dataset MEGRE images, echo number one or two was
    exported to the treatment planning system Eclipse v.15.1 where the CoM
    points of the gold fiducial marker signal voids were defined by multiple
    observers and exported as DICOM RT-structures. Further details on this are
    provided in an article currently in review for publication. All fiducial
    identifications were confirmed to be correct using the corresponding CT
    images.

## File formats
Compressed NIfTI (.nii.gz) file format for both images and ground truth segmentations. The data contains an image volume for each patient, for each echo time.

Data augmentation was performed for each of the 326 patients with random image rotations in an interval between -15 to 15 degrees around the superior-inferior patient axis using linear interpolation. Image data for each echo for each patient time was handled separately but subjected to the same amount of rotation. The same rotation was applied to the ground truth labels using nearest neighbor interpolation (to avoid producing non-binary mask values). The augmented data and labels for each patient data was saved as a new subject, producing a total of 652 subjects in the train/validation dataset, which equaled a total of 1946 fiducial objects. No data augmentation was performed for the test data set containing 40 patients.

All image data for all echos in all datasets was independently N4 bias field corrected in an image pre-processing pipeline.

Train/validation data set and ground truth label:  
XXXXXXXXX = Real patients  
XXXXXXXXXAug = Augmented data

Test data set and ground truth label:  
XXXXXXXXXtest= real patients  

One patient had four fiducial markers inserted and was excluded in the deep learning study (in review). This patient has suffix \_4fid in its name. Each patient volume for each echo in test data set was subjected to Z-score normalization after N4 bias field correction.
