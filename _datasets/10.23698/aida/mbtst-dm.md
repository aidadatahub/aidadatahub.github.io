    14711 digital mammography (DM) examinations from screening, usually
    including two projections (mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal) of each
    breast. Categorized cancer positive/negative. 95 cancer cases diagnosed on
    DM.

    Part of this dataset is directly available for inspection for partners on
    the AIDA platform, and the rest can be made available on request.

    This dataset is an anonymized excerpt from a dataset with richer associated
    data, collected in a research project which is still ongoing. The authors
    welcome proposals for new impactful research collaborations.

    The mammography cancer screening was carried out as part of the Malmö Breast
    Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (MBTST) and all women were examined with both
    mammography and one-view wide angle breast tomosynthesis. The examinations
    were read in separate reading arms and this dataset only includes the
    results from the mammography reading arm. Presence of cancer was determined
    by an experienced radiologist and verified by a second radiologist. Cancers
    were verified with biopsy.

### Pixel position scaling
Coordinates given are relative to the image *width*. To get the correct pixel
position, X coordinates (and Y coordinates!) should therefore be multiplied with
the image *width*.
