    30 clinical routine CTPA examinations, performed on a Philips Brilliance 64
    CT or GE Lightspeed VCT. 14317 axial images (1 or 0,625mm) plus additional
    reformats. 5 of the CTPAs are positive for pulmonary embolism and have all
    the emboli carefully delineated by an experienced radiologist.

    All pulmonary emboli have been delineated by an experienced radiologist - in
    an image by image process (in axial view 1 or 0,625mm images) using MITK
    Workbench. 1 283 annotations were made, in a total of 38 emboli.
