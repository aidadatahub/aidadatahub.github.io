    This dataset consists of 361 whole slide images (WSI) - 296 malignant from
    women with invasive breast cancer (HER2 neg) and 65 benign. The tumours have
    been classified with four SNOMED-CT categories based on morphology: invasive
    duct carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, in situ carcinoma, and others.
    4144 separate annotations have been made to segment different tissue
    structures connected to ontologies.

    The breast tumours were classified with four SNOMED-CT categories based on
    morphology: invasive duct carcinoma, Invasive lobular carcinoma, in situ
    carcinoma and others. 4144 separate annotations were made to segment
    different tissue structures connected to ontologies. One physician were
    responsible for the manual annotations controlled by a second pathologist.

## File formats
### Pixel position scaling
Coordinates given are relative to the image *width*. To get the correct pixel
position, X coordinates (and Y coordinates!) should therefore be multiplied with
the image *width*.
