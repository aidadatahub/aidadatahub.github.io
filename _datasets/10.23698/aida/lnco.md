## Annotation details

### Labels

The following labels exists:

- roi_lgl_norm:: Region contains a lymph node section that do not contain tumor-positive areas, eg, is normal or negative. (but see also note below)

- roi_lgl_unknown:: Region contains a lymph node for which ground truth has not been established.

- roi_lgl_tumor:: Region contains a lymph node where at least some areas are tumor-positive areas. (Might not be annotated)

- roi_lgl_exclude:: Contains lymph node that was determined to be of poor quality or contain severe artifacts from scanning. Would be excluded from clinial review (not suitable).

- tumor:: region exclusively contains tumor pixels (but see also excl category below)

- excl & excl_artifact:: these areas should be substracted from tumor-annotated regions to gain pure-tumor pixels.

- bkg: region contains only background pixels

NOTE: `tumor` annotations are not exhaustive, meaning, there might be more tumor areas in `lgl_roi_tumor` lymph nodes than annotated with `tumor` annotations.

NOTE: Some `roi_lgl_norm` areas contain tumor cells that are from an accidental contamination of the glass during processing. This is normal during routine clinical work and a challenge that automated systems should deal with in an appropriate manner. This is a very easy task for human pathologists to discern.

NOTE: `tumor` regions not within a `roi_lgl_*` region should be assumed to be annotations of tumor in the the primary tumor. This can easily be verified visually, and the primary tumor is always on the initial blocks of the case (A..B...C etc)

### Sampling procedure

Sampling procedure: Query for patients with confirmed adenocarcinomas that underwent colorectomy with subsequent lymphnode review as part of TNM-staging. Query selected N cases with a relatively high number of reported positive lymph nodes.

Source: Two medical clinics in Sweden.

### Descriptive statistics

```
LNCO1
  patients: 39
  cases: 39
  images: 977
     median dimensions(WxH px): 49799 x 38729
     median resolution (micrometer per pixel): 0.4959
  annotations:
    number: 7379
    lymph node sections (roi) 1557
      which are negative 712
      which are positive 292
      which are unassessed 525
    images with at least one detailed tumor annotation: 165
```
## File formats
### Pixel position scaling
Coordinates given are relative to the image *width*. To get the correct pixel
position, X coordinates (and Y coordinates!) should therefore be multiplied with
the image *width*.
