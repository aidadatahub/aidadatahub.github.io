  description: |
    The dataset consists of 99 H&E-stained whole slide skin images (WSI) - 49
    abnormal and 50 normal cases. All significant abnormal findings identified
    are outlined and categorized into 13 types such as actinic keratosis, basal
    cell carcinoma and dermatofibroma. Other tissue components, such as
    epidermis, adnexal structures, as well as the surgical margin are delineated
    to create a complete histological map. In total, 16741 separate annotations
    have been made to segment the different tissue structures and link them to
    ontological information.

  annotation: |
    One physician was responsible for the manual annotations controlled by a
    second pathologist. Accurate annotations were made over the whole tissues.
    16741 separate annotations were made.

    The following findings were annotated in the abnormal cases: actinic
    keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, dysplastic nevus,
    intradermal nevus, keratoachantoma, lentigo malignant melanoma, malignant
    melanoma, malignant melanoma in situ, scar, seborrheic keratosis, squamous
    cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Other areas annotated:
    abnormal, acanthosis, artifacts, dermis, epidermis, fibrosis, fibrin body,
    granuloma, inflammation, inflammatory edema, normal, perichondrium, reactive
    cellular changes, skin appendage structure, surgical margins, structure of
    cartilage of auditory canal, subcutaneous fatty tissue, subcutaneous tissue,
    surgical margins and from which body part the skin was excised.

    In the normal skin cases were following structures chosen to be annotated:
    artifact, dermis, epidermis, normal skin, perichondrium, skin and
    subcutaneous structure, skin appendage structure, skin structure, structure
    of cartilage of auditory canal, subcutaneous fatty tissue, subcutaneous
    tissue and surgical margins.

## File formats
### Pixel position scaling
Coordinates given are relative to the image *width*. To get the correct pixel
position, X coordinates (and Y coordinates!) should therefore be multiplied with
the image *width*.
