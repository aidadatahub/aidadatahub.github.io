  description: |
    A dataset containing 1257 shoulder radiographs from 406 patients. Shoulder fractures in the humerus, clavicle and scapula are classified according to the 2018 AO/OTA classification. The radiographs are also classified for degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis and cuff arthropathy. The radiographs are classified by experienced orthopaedic surgeons specialized in shoulder surgery.
