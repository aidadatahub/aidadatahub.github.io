  description: |
    77 CT abdomen (computed tomography) examinations taken with contrast in
    venous phase. All cases showed liver malignancies. Manual oncological
    annotations were made by a radiologist and these were controlled by a second
    experienced radiologist. All changes with a diameter greater than 5mm were
    segmented and assumed metastases (cysts excluded as defined by HU). 317
    lesions were annotated.
