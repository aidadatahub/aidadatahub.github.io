    Segmentation was done first with an interactive software (Mialab), followed
    by manual inspection and correction using ITKSNAP. The interactive method is
    based on fuzzy connectedness followed by level set method. Both the
    segmentation mask and annotated anatomical landmarks were created by a
    trained radiologist.

## File formats
### Importing binary masks to numpy
The dataset contains a DICOM SEG file, which can be converted to an ITK image file (mha, nifti, etc) by using [dcmqi](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi) and the command line tool [segimage2itkimage](https://qiicr.gitbook.io/dcmqi-guide/opening/cmd_tools/seg/segimage2itkimage), which is straightforward to read into a numpy array.
