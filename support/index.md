The target audience for the AIDA Data Hub Support function is the
[AIDA](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-arena) community. Inquiries from non-AIDA organizations are also welcome, and will be entertained
best-effort within available resources (cf [Prioritization](#prioritization)).

## Costs
Support is initially intended to be provided to AIDA researchers free of charge,
as per SciLifeLab
[International Advisory Board](https://www.scilifelab.se/about-us/management/#h-international-advisory-board)
recommendation. User fees are under consideration and are planned to align with
other support functions within [SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se),
[NBIS](https://nbis.se) and [BIIF](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/bioimage-informatics/).

## Extent of support

* Ask a question - Always welcome!
* NBIS [drop-in](https://nbis.se/events/) support - AIDA Data Hub often joins.
* Consultation - Explorative, a meeting or two.
* Support project - Longer engagements, one or more weeks.

## Prioritization
Support is provided at best effort and within available resources.

The intention is to let user needs drive support prioritization.

The target audience for the AIDA Data Hub Support function is the AIDA
community. The main topic is medical imaging diagnostics AI research and
innovation. The focus is on projects with clear connection to the broader
SciLifeLab aims, including precision medicine and multi-omics.

In the event of limited resources, prioritization will be carried out by
AIDA Data Hub management, advised by AIDA management. Conflicts if any are
resolved by the AIDA Steering group.

## General Data Arocessing agreements with Swedish Universities
As a part of the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS), AIDA Data Hub is covered by existing Data Processing Agreements (DPA) with most of the Swedish universities with life science research. You can find a list of the existing agreements [here](https://nbis.se/about/steering/general-processing-agreements). This means that getting support from AIDA Data Hub when working with sensitive data is simplified for researchers at these universities. To use the sensitive data compute services additional DPA agreements need to be established.
